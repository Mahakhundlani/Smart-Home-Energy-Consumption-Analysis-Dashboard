# Smart Home Energy Consumption Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze smart home energy consumption patterns. The analysis focuses on time-based usage, seasonal trends, appliance-level consumption, and appliance load categories to uncover meaningful insights that support energy optimization, cost reduction, and sustainable household practices.

The dashboard enables users to explore energy behavior dynamically using filters such as year, season, time category, household size, appliance type, and weekdays.
